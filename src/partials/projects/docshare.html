    DocShare is a web application designed to allow users to create, modify, search, and share text documents. Think of text editing with a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">revision control system</a> built in. Users can decide whom to share their documents with, assign read or write permissions to their documents, and view previous versions of their documents. Users with escalated privileges can be assigned to moderate the system. Built using PHP, MySQL, and HTML.
