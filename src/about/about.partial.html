<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    My programming experience started in 2006, when I self-taught PHP as my first programming language. Over time, I have learned several other programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. In my spare time, I am usually coding side projects or learning new technologies.
</p>
<p>
    In regards to operating systems, I have experience with both <a href="//windows.microsoft.com ">Windows</a> and Linux, having nearly two decades of Windows experience (95, 98, Vista, XP, and 7), as well as several years of Linux (<a href="//www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and <a href="//www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>). Currently, I switch between Windows 7 and Arch Linux depending on the necessity of the situation.

                <p>
                    Personally, I think programming is fun. The ability to solve problems and create solutions through code has always been fascinating to me. Programming languages, in particular, has been interesting to learn. The design pattern of programming languages effect how one would go about solving a problem in that language. Different languages requires different thought processes and can have multiple solutions to solve the same problem.

                <p>
                    I have always been fond of computer games. Just like many others, I enjoy playing computer games (there, I admit it). Nowadays, I enjoy developing computer games. For me, game development is where ideas fly, where creativity meets code, and where code ultimately becomes a game.

                <h4>Chess</h4>
                <p>
                    If you haven't guessed it already (from this site's URL address), I love playing chess. I have been playing chess since third grade in elementary school, having participated in tournaments, and earning several trophies along the way. I like chess for its ability to test one's strategical planning, decision making, and above all, patience.

<h2>About This Website</h2>
<p>
    This website was created with <a href="//angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>, a web application framework for creating dynamic, single-page applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The motivation was to experiment with new web technologies and to further improve my knowledge of AngularJS. The site is hosted on <a href="//pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. Its source code is publicly available on my <a href="//github.com/chessmasterhong/chessmasterhong.github.io">GitHub repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Designed with minimalism and functionality in mind, each site component was carefully selected, designed, and distributed throughout the site. Several web design concepts were implemented such as <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Responsive Web Design</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_web_design">Adaptive Web Design</a>. Optimization techniques were incorporated to maximize efficiency while delivering equivalent content. The site successfully validates against the <a href="//validator.w3.org/check?uri=chessmasterhong.github.io&amp;charset=%28detect+automatically%29&amp;doctype=Inline&amp;group=0">W3C HTML5</a> standard. It tries to conform to "best practices" by performing <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">code linting</a> and following style guidelines. Automated build processes were created and utilized to expedite tedious tasks, thus directing additional focus towards site development.
