<h2>About This Website</h2>
<p>
    This website was created with <a href="//angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>, a web application framework for creating dynamic, single-page applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The motivation was to experiment with new web technologies and to further improve my knowledge of AngularJS. The site is hosted on <a href="//pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. Its source code is publicly available on my <a href="//github.com/chessmasterhong/chessmasterhong.github.io">GitHub repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Designed with minimalism and functionality in mind, each site component was carefully selected, designed, and distributed throughout the site. Several web design concepts were implemented such as <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Responsive Web Design</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_web_design">Adaptive Web Design</a>. Optimization techniques were incorporated to maximize efficiency while delivering equivalent content. The site successfully validates against the <a href="//validator.w3.org/check?uri=chessmasterhong.github.io&amp;charset=%28detect+automatically%29&amp;doctype=Inline&amp;group=0">W3C HTML5</a> standard. It tries to conform to "best practices" by performing <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">code linting</a> and following style guidelines. Automated build processes were created and utilized to expedite tedious tasks, thus directing additional focus towards site development.
