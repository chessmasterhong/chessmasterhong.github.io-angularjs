Over time, I have learned several other programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. I have knowledge of PHP, JavaScript, C++, HTML5, CSS3, MySQL, and some Python.</p><p>In regards to operating systems, I have experience with both <a href="//windows.microsoft.com ">Windows</a> and Linux, having nearly two decades of Windows experience (95, 98, Vista, XP, and 7), as well as several years of Linux (<a href="//www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and <a href="//www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>). Currently, I switch between Windows 7 and Arch Linux on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>Personally, I think programming is fun. The ability to solve problems and create solutions through code has always been fascinating to me. In my spare time, I am usually coding side projects or learning new technologies.</p><h2>Interests</h2><ul><li><h3>Technology Related</h3><ul><li><h4>Programming Language</h4><p>Programming languages, in general, has always been interesting to learn. The design pattern of programming languages effect how one would go about solving a problem in that language. Different languages can have different solutions to solve the same problem. Even just the ability to solve problems by using code is fascinating.</p></li><li><h4>Web Development</h4><p></p></li><li><h4>Game Development</h4><p>I have always been fond of computer games. Just like many others, I enjoy playing computer games (there, I admit it). Nowadays, I enjoy developing computer games. Game development is where ideas fly, where creativity meets code, and where code becomes a game.</p></li><li><h4>Artifical Intelligence</h4><p></p></li><li><h4>Adaptive Learning</h4><p></p></li></ul></li><li><h3>Non-technology Related</h3><ul><li><h4>Chess</h4><p>If you haven't guessed it already (from this site's URL address), I love playing chess. I have been playing chess since third grade in elementary school, having participated in tournaments, and earning several trophies along the way. I like chess for its ability to test one's strategical planning, descision making, and above all, patience.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>About this site</h2><p>This website was created with <a href="//angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>, a web application framework for creating dynamic, single-page applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
