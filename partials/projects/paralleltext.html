<p>ParallelText is a web application built using Python on top of the Django web framework. This application enables users to read a text in two different languages in parallel.

Our goal was to create a web-based tool to easily create parallel texts. In essence, our project was an extension and generalization of <a href=http://www.waste.org/~roadrunner/Hegel/PhenSpirit>this project</a> previously attempted by one of our project members.</p>
