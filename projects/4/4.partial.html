<p>Super Mario World: Koopa Krisis is a remake of the original Super Mario World platformer for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was built using JavaScript on top of the <a href="//impactjs.com">ImpactJS game engine</a>. The project was developed under the City College of New York's chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery's Game Development Student Interest Group for educational purposes only. The goals for this project were to create a web browser version of one of the Nintendo's most popular games, to understand how to use ImpactJS, and to learn JavaScript.</p><h2>My Roles, Experiences, and Challenges</h2><p>Prior to this project, I had never worked heavily with JavaScript. I had also never had any experience with the ImpactJS game engine. When I was given my first task to implement the AI for a basic "stalking" enemy, I learned how to analyze and break the problem given into smaller parts until it was small enough to be code-able. It was from this method of dissecting the problem did I quickly learn JavaScript and in turn, ImpactJS.</p><p>Following my initial task, I had been given further tasks to implement more enemy AI. Near the end of the project, I suggested that we include a final challenge and as a result, <a href="//bitbucket.org/DrkSephy/smw-koopa-krisis/history-node/1544cd73a481/lib/game/entities/enemies/iggy_koopa.js">I was responsible for implementing the final boss</a>, <a href="//bitbucket.org/DrkSephy/smw-koopa-krisis/src/1544cd73a481/lib/game/entities/enemies/iggy_koopa.js">Iggy Koopa</a>. I was not given much instructions on what features it should have, so I used some imagination and in three days, Iggy Koopa was done. I had utilized all of my knowledge of the existing enemy AIs I have worked on prior and incorporated it into the final boss, along with some brand new AI, not seen in any other enemies. Implementing this beast was both challenging yet fun experience for me. In the end, I personally felt this was perhaps my proudest contribution to the project.</p><p><a href="//bitbucket.org/DrkSephy/smw-koopa-krisis/commits/all?search=slope">Another major contribution to the game was slopes.</a> This task was not assigned to me, but rather I overheard during one of our team meetings that the built-in ImpactJS slopes were not what we wanted. Previous attempts to resolve this issue ended up in failure. I, too, attempted this once and reached a dead-end. However, less than one week later, I tackled the problem again with fruitful results, thanks to some calculus, physics, and persistence.</p><p>Lastly, with only a few days before the final release of our game, my project leader and I scrambled to make finishing touches to the game. I suggested that we should have a final, secret level. He agreed and with that, I implemented the necessary checks to enter the secret level while he designed the (awesome) levels. We coordinated well and was able to release the game on time as expected.</p><p>Most of the knowledge I had gained during this project has greatly prepared me for the <a href="/projects/5">next project</a>.</p>
